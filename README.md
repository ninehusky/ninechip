# ninechip
An interpreter for the Chip-8 language, created in Java.

You'll probably need to find your own ROMs somewhere on the internet to use this.

## Resources Used
trekawek's [coffee-gb](https://github.com/trekawek/coffee-gb) repo was a great reference for improving the structural decomposition of the emulator. In addition, [Austin Morlan]https://austinmorlan.com/posts/chip8_emulator/'s implementation of the DXYN opcode was essential in getting me to pass several test ROMs.

## Special Thanks
This project would not have been possible without Kanye West, Tyler, the Creator, and the Twitch streamers still live at 2AM.
